# Design-Pattern-Lab

-This course consists of LLD (low level design).

-In core java, there are mainly three types of design patterns Creational Design Pattern , Structural Design Pattern and Behavioral Design Pattern.

-This labwork is done selecting the theme as RESTAURANT for all design patterns inorder to understand the patterns much more conveniently.

## Creational Design Pattern
1) Factory Pattern 
-used for creating similar types of objects without specifying their concrete clases.
-used when objects are of same type but vary a little in terms of implimentation/data.

2) Abstract Factory Pattern
-used for creating family of similar types of objects without specifying their concrete clases.
-when we need to specify 2 things while creating object (e.g.- while creating mobile we need to specify Brand and Model_no.)

3) Builder Pattern
-clear sepration between construction and representation of object and this pattern solves the problem of complex constructors.
-for getting clear idea understand it as when output can have two parts essential and optional we use this pattern.

4) Prototype Pattern
-cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.
-used when you want avoid multiple object creation of same instance.

5) Singleton Pattern
-class has only one instance while providing global access point to this instance.
-two types :
--eager intialization - creates object in advance , just after starting the application (i.e. object created as soon as class called)
--lazy initialization - restricts object creation until created by application code.
